# NAME
## M_msg - convert any scalar type to a string using unlimited polymorphic variables

## DESCRIPTION
This is a small module that can convert a list of variables of any
of the most common default types and convert them to a string.


## BUILDING THE MODULES
     git clone https://github.com/urbanjost/M_msg.git
     cd M_msg/src
     # change Makefile if not using gfortran(1)
     make

This will compile the Fortran module and and basic test
program and run the test and display the manpage for the routine.

## INSTALLATION


## USER DOCUMENTATION
   - a simple [manpage](https://urbanjost.github.io/M_msg/src.3.html) in HTML form


## ADDITIONAL DIRECTORY DESCRIPTIONS
There are 
    - manpages in the man/man3 directory 
    - HTML documentation in the docs/ directory.
    - test/ contains a simple test program
    - build/ contains files generated by the fpm(Fortran Package Mananger)

## UNIT TESTS
The unit test runs with

    # typical *nix installation
    cd src;man
    # if you have fpm(1) installed
    fpm test


## FUTURE
   Ultimately the goal is to release this as an fpm(1) package
   as described at [https://fortran-lang.org](https://fortran-lang.org)
   when there is a production version of fpm(1) available.

   In the mean time it is the first and simplest module set up using
   fpm(1) in an attempt to explore the use of fpm(1). The initial
   goal is to set up all the seperate modules with fpm(1) and then
   change the FUNIX repository to build entirely using fpm(1) as an
   experiment.
