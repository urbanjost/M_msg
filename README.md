# NAME
## M_msg - convert any scalar type to a string using unlimited polymorphic variables

## DESCRIPTION
This is a small module that can convert a list of variables of any of
the most common default types to a string.

It performs such a low-level operation that it is likely to be a
dependency of other larger modules so it is in its own module to prevent
circular dependencies.

## BUILDING THE MODULE
A conventional *nix install:

```bash
     git clone https://github.com/urbanjost/M_msg.git
     cd M_msg/src
     # change Makefile if not using gfortran(1)
     make  
```
This will compile the Fortran module and basic test
program and run the test and display the manpage for the routine.

## SUPPORTS FPM

Alternatively, download the github repository and build it with 
fpm ( as described at [Fortran Package Manager](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm) )

```bash
     git clone https://github.com/urbanjost/M_msg.git
     cd M_msg
     fpm build
     fpm test
```

or just list it as a dependency in your fpm.toml project file.

     [dependencies]
