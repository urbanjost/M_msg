As proposed by @msz59 on Fortran Discourse, this serves a purpose which
is not rounding to specific number of significant digits but rather
rounding to the given decimal (power) position, that position given by
-n, i.e. 10**(-n), much as a "F0.N" format would provide, while an "E"
format would show a specified number of significant digits.
